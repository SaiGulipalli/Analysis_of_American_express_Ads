Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of internet savvy users. Companies in the financial services domain leverage this huge internet traffic arriving at their interface by strategically placing ads/promotions for cross selling of various financial products on a plethora of web pages. The digital analytics unit of Best Cards Company uses cutting edge data science and machine learning for successful promotion of its valuable card products. They believe that a predictive model that forecasts whether a session involves a click on the ad/promotion would help them extract the maximum out of the huge clickstream data that they have collected.
